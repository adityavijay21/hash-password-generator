# Hash Password Generator

A React-based web application for generating secure passwords using cryptographic hash algorithms.

## Overview

Hash Password Generator creates strong, unique passwords from user input and selected hash algorithms. It's designed for users who need to generate secure passwords based on memorable phrases or personal information, without storing the original input.

## Key Features

- Supports MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512 algorithms
- Customizable password length and character types
- Real-time password strength indicator
- One-click copy to clipboard
- Advanced settings for fine-tuned control

## Use Case

Ideal for users who want to create strong, unique passwords for different services while only needing to remember a single passphrase. By using different hash algorithms or slight variations in input, users can generate distinct passwords for each service without the need for a password manager.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/hash-password-generator.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `npm start`
